# lookApp
LookApp is our final project for Programming Paradigms class. It'll be developed using Python 3, HTML, CSS and through Electron, we'll deploy a desktop version of it.
The main goal of LookApp is to recreate Snapchat's basic functions: to send and receive pictures which will destroy themselves after they've been opened.
